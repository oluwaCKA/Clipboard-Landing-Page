## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned about columns property in CSS, been my very first time of using it, I am so elated.


### Continued development

I'd like to know more about media queries, especially responsiveness for smaller  screens, I'm still confused on the width to use when it comes to smaller screens
I will definitely work on that.


### Useful resources

- [Stack overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for responsivess questions and answers. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand columns property in css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
